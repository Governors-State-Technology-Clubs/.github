## How to Get Involved

Joining CSS is simple and straightforward. Here’s the process to get started:

1. **Attend a Meeting**:  
   Come to one of our regular meetings to meet current members, learn more about the club, and get an overview of our ongoing projects. This is your opportunity to get a feel for our community and what we’re working on. At the meeting, standard GSU attendance is taken.

2. **Join the Discord Server**:  
   After attending the meeting, you’ll be invited to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/J7EezeQHmC). There, you will interact with members, receive updates, and reports for asynchronous involvement. When you join, a bot will automatically DM you to gather some basic information for internal registration. This helps us to ensure you're added to the appropriate platforms we use for our activities and communications.

3. **Register for Additional Platforms**:  
   Once you've officially joined our Discord, you'll be invited to other platforms we host (e.g., GitHub Club Organization and other hooked API's) for project collaboration and communication. You'll have access to these tools once you've completed your registration.

4. **Schedule an Interview**:  
   At the end of the meeting, you’ll have the opportunity to schedule a personal interview with one of our senior members. During this interview, we’ll assess where you are in your development, discuss your goals, and help you find the best path for your growth within the club. This is a key step for understanding your current skill level and helping you progress in your technical journey.

We look forward to meeting you and helping you grow as a part of the Computer Science Society!
